                consists of three primary branches: the Indian Army, Indian
                Navy, and Indian Air Force.

            <p>
                The Indian Army is the land-based branch of the defence force
                and is responsible for protecting the country's borders and
                maintaining internal security. The Indian Navy is the maritime
                branch of the defence force and is responsible for safeguarding

                Indian Air Force is the air-based branch of the defence force
                and is responsible for protecting the country's airspace and
                providing air support to the other branches of the defence
                force.
