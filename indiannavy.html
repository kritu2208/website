            <h1>Indian Navy</h1>
            <p>
                The Indian Navy is the maritime branch of the Indian Armed
                Forces and is responsible for safeguarding the country's
                coastlines and strategic interests at sea. The Indian Navy
                operates a wide range of ships, submarines and aircraft, and is
                capable of undertaking a wide range of missions including
                maritime security, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief,
                and power projection.
            </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                The Indian Navy traces its origins back to the East India
                Company's Marine which was founded in 1612 to protect British
                merchant shipping in the region. The East India Company's Marine
                was renamed as the Indian Marine and later as the Royal Indian
                Marine in 1892. After India's independence in 1947, the Royal
                Indian Marine was renamed as the Indian Navy.
            </p>
            <h2>Operations</h2>
            <p>
                The Indian Navy's primary roles include maritime security, power
                projection, and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. It
                conducts regular patrols in the Indian Ocean to ensure the
                safety of India's maritime trade and to prevent piracy and
                smuggling. The Indian Navy also maintains a presence in the
                strategic waters of the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea to
                protect Indian shipping and to promote regional stability.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to its operational roles, the Indian Navy also plays
                an active role in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief
                efforts. The Indian Navy has been involved in a number of
                disaster relief operations, both in India and abroad, and has
                also provided aid to countries affected by natural disasters.
            </p>
            <h2>Fleet</h2>
            <p>
                The Indian Navy operates a wide range of ships and submarines
                including aircraft carriers, destroyers, frigates, corvettes,
                submarines, and patrol vessels. The Indian Navy also operates a
                large number of aircraft, including fighter jets, helicopters,
                and maritime patrol aircraft.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Indian Navy is also undergoing a modernization program to
                enhance its capabilities and to modernize its fleet. This
                includes the acquisition of new ships, submarines and aircraft,
                as well as the upgrading of existing vessels and aircraft.
